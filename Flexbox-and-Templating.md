CSS continues to be a total mystery to me and I personally do not look forward to having to use it at all. I don't mind using in some cases, but prefer to stay in the JS or HTML side, though, im also not really that fond of HTML, though I understand it much better than CSS.

With that said, here are some of the items that helped me in the excercise @ https://flexboxfroggy.com/ :
- justify-content
- align-items
- flex-direction
- order
- align-self
- flex-wrap
- flex-flow
- align-content

I should be able to further learn how to use these new tools i future CSS manipulation. The flexboxfroggy helped me to become a little more familiar with these tools.
